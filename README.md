# DBMS-SQL-Project
This is a DBMS and SQL project I did in my _first semester_ of **BSc.Data Science And Bussiness Analytics** with 2 of my classmates.
We have to take or create a scenario to create a ER Diagram based on that scenario and then create components of database i.e. tables and perform SQL queries on them on our own.

## Components
**1.Scenario:** We have created our own scenario   

**2.ER Diagram:** We have created the ER Diagram using ERDPlus software available on internet.To open the attached .erdplus file for the ER diagram please open it through [ERDPlus](https://erdplus.com/) website.

**3.Relationships and Cardinalities:** We have mentioned the Relationships and Cardinalities of the tables in the attached report which is in the form of pdf.

**4.Relational Schema:** We have created the Relational Schema using ERDPlus software available on internet.To open the attached .erdplus file for the Relational Schema please open it through [ERDPlus](https://erdplus.com/) website.

**5.SQL Queries:** The SQL code for creating tables, inserting values and performing different queries is in text as well as SQL file
